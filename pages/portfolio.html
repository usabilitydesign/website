Videos of work I did while at Content Analyst Company: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/r9eb70o8pow37lv/AACCQAXAlXZDNOTqEtUA6DBqa?dl=0
With the exception of the “Synapse” video, I was working inside an existing interface that was not designed by me, and not all of the code was written by me.
The “Synapse” video is of a prototype that my co-worker and I built for a tradeshow demo in about 5 days. Some of the D3 work was done by a senior developer who customized our CAAT platform for this demo. Synapse is an example of the design direction wanted the main product to take, where there is more connectivity between the visualizations and the documents they affect and where the visualization is more of a tool than an illustration. One usability issue we found with this demo was the client often wanted to skip the visualization and simply choose two elements.   
The “dynamic summary” video is a prototype where I took the company's original idea of highlighting sentences that were relevant (seen in the “expand_newtab” video as a dark blue) to the current search and created an interface where the user could toggle between a static “first 25 word” summary and a summary of concatenated relative sentences that are dynamically generated with each search by our CAAT platform.
The “Highlight” video is a mechanism I built in Cerebrant as a demo for functionality in our Synapse product. The design is rudimentary but the idea is that in our Synapse product, where we are looking at sets of documents that connect two nodes, you would see only the sentences relevant to those nodes and a double bar graph slider that shows how many relevant sentences, on a 10-point scale, relate to that node (note: I am only showing a single bar graph is in this video). This slider would allow a researcher to quickly scan the connection between the two nodes and identify supporting documentations for the connection.
“Ringviz” is a visualization designed by the PM. I did most of the Angular work integrating this into the current code.

I like to do a process I like to call “skeleton first” which is simply creating a black and white design structure in code that clients, users, and the design and development team can all bang on and think through. Designers would use the structure to “skin” the app; back-end developers would start filling in the “brain”; UI developers would connect the “nervous system and muscles”; Ops gets the “heart” going; and QA hooks “Frankenstein” up to monitoring so we know he’s alive and well.
I created this prototype in about 4 hours total for an interview I had with Bloomberg Law. They provided a project brief. For this project I used Jekyll, Bootstrap and Angular. It is hooked up to the Yumly API (which does have limits for the free membership so sometimes fails) and I also created a JSON file for the riders using Mr. Data Converter. As I worked, I created a Trello board that roughly captured my tasks and creative process. The Trello board can be found here: https://trello.com/b/w7CblBOi/this-is-what-i-do as well as here: https://trello.com/b/cmMu9Ekr/alternate-process-board 
Tool that converts table code to a responsive design: http://ineedyourbrain.github.io/data-th-converter/
I created this tool for FINRA while we were converting their very large site over to a new responsive Drupal site. My co-worker was going to have to hand code about 200 tables to make them responsive and the tool I created saved her several days of work.
Tool to pull you Trello boards in your Google Calendar: https://www.google.com/calendar/render?gadgeturl=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ineedyourbrain/timeblocker/master/timeblocker/timeblocker3.xml
Designers tend to track their work more granularly than developers. Being in between both worlds, I wanted to create a tool where I could block out chunks of time for coding, give exposure to my managers as to what I was working on and when, and easily shift the blocks as my week changed. For a long time I used Google Calendar for this, but I was getting tired of translating my projects from JIRA to Google every week. As a prototype, I created a Google Calendar Widget that pulled in projects from my Trello board and will eventually connect to JIRA.

Responsive site built in Jekyll with Twitter Bootstrap and JQuery.
PSDs were provided. I did the responsive breakdowns and code for the quiz

Additionally, I have other design and development work that was not completed by me, but which I either did a good portion of the coding and initial prototype, or in which the PM chose to take another route. Screenshots for each project can be found at: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/xaqmcvy8fna4rwi/AAAjk1a1GSPnfxVF30SQy8swa?dl=0 
Gas Leaks: http://www.gannett-cdn.com/experiments/usatoday/2014/gas-leaks/
I still have a lot of the code for this on my machine and can demo it. I did the majority of the mapbox work a code for the graphs for each facility. 
Wait Times at VA hospitals: http://www.gannett-cdn.com/experiments/usatoday/2014/va-hospital/index.html 
This design is not maintained by me so it is getting messy. I put the original designs for this in my “other work” folder. I wrote all the code for this and created the mapbox directive.
The “LUX” project was an interface design I did for LifeTech, now ThermoFisher. The client said it was the best money they ever spent. The interface is a Java Swing app and was developed offshore.
Where the Jobs Are was a rapid prototype I created with fake data and Google’s Web Kit.
